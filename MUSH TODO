MUSH TODO

OPTIMIZATIONS
- share cell vertices instead of having each cell recalculate shared vertex positions/vals
- crawling cubes (start at a cell that's on the surface then only explore neighbor cells that are also on the surface)

LOOKS
- Surface normals (do flat shading aka one normal per cell (calculated at the center))

PLAY
- a big ball with little ones orbiting it
- a value field that starts with all 1s (a cube) and then you can add/subtract from the volume by touching and value is added/subtracted from the cells around the one your touch hit
  * can figure out what cell was touched by having a render buffer whose pixels store the xyz of the cell that generated that face
